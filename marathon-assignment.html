                                     <!-- Answer to the question number 2 -->

  What is JavaScript:
  JavaScript is a programming language primarily used in web development. It enhance the interactivity and 
  functionality of websites. It can be executed in web browsers and server side too.

  primary purpose of js in web development:
  1. Interactivity Purpose: 
  Js allows to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It response on user actions like,
              a.clicks, 
              b.mouse movements,
              c.keystrokes, 
              d.features like dropdown menus, 
              e. image sliders, 
              f.form validation and so on.
  
  2.Document Object Model Purpose:
  Js can be used to add, remove, or modify elements on a web page dynamically.

  3.Data Validation Purpose:
  Js is used for form validation, ensuring that user-submitted data is correct before it is sent to a server. 
  It helps to improve data quality and user experience.

  4.Asynchronous Operations Purpose:
  Js helps to the operations such as making AJAX requests to fetch data from servers without reloading the 
  entire page. It gives real-time updates and a smoother user experience.

  5.Browser Compatibility Purpose:
  Js is used to handle functionality and interactivity of the web pages in various web browsers.

  There are several more purposes of using js in web development.

  Differences among var, let, and const:
  
  1. var:
     a. Only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
     b. If declared outside of a function, it becomes global variables.
     c. Allows redeclaration which can lead overwriting of variables.
     d. It follows function scope but not block scope.

  2. let:
     a. Only accessible within the block scope or function in which they are declared.
     b. It is not initialized until the declaration statement is executed.
     c. Prevents redeclaration and allows to reassign the variable's value.
     d. It follows block scope.

  3. const:
     a. Accessible within the block scope like the let.
     b. Must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
     c. Cannot be reassigned once initialized.
     d. It follows block scope.



                                          <!-- Answer to the question number 4 -->
       
  Concept of Scope in JavaScript:
  Scope implies the context where variables and functions are declared and accessed. It defines how variables 
  and functions will be visible and accessible in programming. 
  
  Differences between Global scope and Local scope:

  1. Global scope:
    a. Variables and functions can be called from anywhere in the code.
    b. Variables in global scope can be declared outside of any function or block.
    c. Not limited to a specific function or block.
    d. leads to naming conflicts and creates bug.

  2. Local scope:
    a. Variables and functions can be called within a function.
    b. Variables in local scope can not be declared outside of any function or block.
    c. Limited within that function and its nested functions.
    d. Prevents naming conflicts and keeps code bug free.



                                          <!-- Answer to the question number 5 -->

  Differences between "null and "undefined":
  
  1.null:
    a. Generally it is not any error but developer's intentional assignment.
    b. Often use developers to represent that something has no value.
    c. Used when need to clear or reset a variable.

  2. undefined:
    a. Shows when a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
    b. Shows when no return statement is provided.
    c. Shows when any property in objects is missing.
